I've written some code to scrape specific pages on the [[http://jojo.wikia.com][JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Wiki]] for characters and the episodes or chapters they appear in.
I then merge the list with itself to generate a new list of characters who are connected by appearing in the same episode or chapter.
Lastly I draw network diagrams for all parts and for each part individually.

* to do
- Weight edges by the number of appearances characters make together
- Color edges by the first part in which characters make an appearance together
- Color nodes by pagerank
- Hide node labels except for major characters
- Interactive features: (in notebook? in HTML?)
  - mouse-over an edge to see what appearance it corresponds to
  - mouse-over a node to see some data about the character
    - a picture? wiki categories?
