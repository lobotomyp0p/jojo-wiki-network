I've written some code to scrape specific pages on the [[http://jojo.wikia.com][JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Wiki]] for characters and the episodes or chapters they appear in.
I then merge the list with itself to generate a new list of characters who are connected by appearing in the same episode or chapter.
Lastly I draw network diagrams for all parts and for each part individually.
